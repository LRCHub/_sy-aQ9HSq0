[00:16.73] Ooh
[00:19.19] You wanted to keep it
[00:22.45] Like somethin' you found
[00:25.66] 'Til you didn't need it
[00:30.51] But you should've seen it
[00:34.08] The way it went down
[00:37.57] Wouldn't believe it
[00:47.07] 
[00:42.89] Wanna know what I told her
[00:46.01] With her hand on my shoulder?
[00:49.30] You were so mediocre
[00:52.82] And we're so glad it's over now
[01:00.59] It's over now
[01:06.96] It's over now
[01:13.82] It's over now
[01:20.32] 
[01:21.33] Camera
[01:23.95] Caught on camera
[01:27.00] The girls on camera
[01:30.11] Your girl's a fan of-
[01:34.54] Miss me
[01:36.90] Say you miss me
[01:40.04] It's such a pity
[01:43.32] We're both so pretty
[01:53.32] 
[01:47.17] I wanna know, where did it go?
[01:50.11] I couldn't tell, I couldn't see
[01:53.33] You weren't around (da-da-da-da), I was alone (da-da-da-da)
[01:56.92] You never once (da-da-da-da) took care of me (da-da-da-da)
[02:25.92] 
[02:00.93] Ooh
[02:03.41] You wanted to keep it
[02:06.54] But you didn't try
[02:10.18] Guess you didn't mean it (maybe)
[02:15.00] Well, maybe your secret
[02:18.08] Is you're just a guy
[02:21.58] That couldn't complete it
[02:34.08] 
[02:26.85] Never got that Ferrari
[02:30.45] Never dance at the party
[02:33.69] Bet it's still mediocre
[02:36.74] I'm just happy it's over now
[02:44.61] It's over now
[02:51.29] It's over now
[02:58.05] (It's over now)
[03:01.62] Ooh, ooh
[03:08.72] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[03:15.22] 
[03:19.44] I (I), I wanna know (I wanna know) where did it go? (Where did it go?)
[03:24.98] I couldn't tell (I couldn't tell), I couldn't see (I couldn't see)
[03:27.94] You weren't around (you weren't around), I was alone (I was alone)
[03:31.28] You never once took care of me (you never once took care of me)
[03:34.84] Wanna know (wanna know)
[03:46.34] 
[03:35.64] It's not that complicated (I couldn't tell, I couldn't see)
[03:39.39] I wasn't satiated (you weren't around, I was alone)
[03:42.39] You weren't that bad, just lazy (you never once took care of me)
[03:45.65] Too self-obsessed to save me
[03:49.14] It's not that complicated
[03:52.41] I wasn't satiated
[03:55.63] You're looking older lately
[03:58.96] Dating another baby
[04:03.55] ('Nother baby)
